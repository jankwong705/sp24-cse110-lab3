        <h4>Unfinished Business from Last Meeting:</h4>
        <div>Although all systems within the Republic have been surveyed, General Grievous' whereabouts are still unclear.

        <h4>New Business from This Meeting:</h4>
        <div>The droid attacks on the Wookies is concerning. Since Kashyyyk is a system we cannot afford to lose, forces will need to be sent to

            <details>
                <summary><b>Master Yoda agreed to head to Kashyyyk to assist them.</b></summary>

        <h4>Miscellaneous:</h4>
        <div>Anakin Skywalker feels discontent towards not being granted the rank of master despite being offered a seat on the Jedi Council.</div>
        <div>His overly close relationship with the Chancellor also raises concerns.</div>
